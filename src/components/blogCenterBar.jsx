                web layout refers to how different design elements on a webpage
                are arranged or structured visually. It includes where headers
                are placed, navigation menus go, content areas live, sidebars
                sit, and footers rest. Good layouts should make it easy for
                people to move throughout your site while understandably
                presenting information.

                Often, people do not realize just how important a good design is
                until after their site has been developed—but this shouldn’t be
                so! You must always remember that users interact with your
                website through its pages; they take action only when they
                understand what path they should follow next… So always design
                around visitors’ needs instead of assuming they’ll adapt
                themselves accordingly because, chances are… they won’t!
